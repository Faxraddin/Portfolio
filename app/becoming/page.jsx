            <h1 className="text-4xl text-gray-700">How I got into coding</h1>
            <p className="text-[18px]">Ever since I was a child, I've had a deep love for art, craft, and the act of creating. Although I found these creative pursuits enjoyable, my self-image always leaned towards a non-regular job, perhaps within a large company, as I'm naturally inclined to introversion. However, by the time I was 15, I had already gained remarkable clarity about my future. I had been working as a waiter, and that experience made it abundantly clear that working under someone else wasn't the path for me.<br></br> <br></br>With unwavering determination and a well-defined plan, I set my sights on a career that resonated with my aspirations. This decision led me to pursue a path that felt absolutely right for me.</p>

            <h1 className="text-4xl text-gray-700">Key things I‚Äôve learned</h1>
            <p className="text-[18px]">Here are a few key takeaways I‚Äôve learned over my years as a designer. They‚Äôve come in handy for me, hopefully they‚Äôll come in handy for you too.</p>

            <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Less is more</h2>
              <p className="text-[18px]">When it comes to coding a website, simplicity and efficiency are key. By minimizing complexity and focusing on essential elements, developers can create robust and user-friendly websites.</p>
              <p className="text-[18px]">For instance, consider a full-stack web developer building an e-commerce site. Instead of incorporating numerous intricate features that might overwhelm users, they might opt for a streamlined design with intuitive navigation. A simplified checkout process, clear product descriptions, and a responsive layout could be prioritized. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also streamlines the development process.</p>
              <p className="text-[18px]">Furthermore, keeping the codebase concise and well-structured is equally important. Implementing efficient algorithms, using modular and reusable components, and minimizing unnecessary code bloat are all part of the "less is more" philosophy in coding. This approach not only makes the website faster and more maintainable but also helps the developer to articulate and understand their design decisions. In full-stack web development, embracing simplicity can lead to a more effective and elegant end product.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Keep learning and challenging yourself</h2>
              <p className="text-[18px]">In any profession, it‚Äôs easy to stagnate and get comfortable. It‚Äôs important for me to read and absorb as much as I can to stay passionate about my craft and to continue to challenge myself and those around me. I try to set aside some time each morning to read and learn something new. </p>
            </div>
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-5">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Done is better than perfect</h2>
              <p className="text-[18px]">If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre probably a stickler for detail. This can however eat up valuable time and money, so I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs usually better to get a product out there as soon as you can, learn from it and improve it over time. This isn‚Äôt an excuse to create crap, but more of a reminder that perfectionism can actually get in the way of designing a great product.</p>
